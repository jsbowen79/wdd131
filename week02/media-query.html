        <h2>Moses 3:5</h2>
        <p>
            And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew. For I, the Lord
            God, created all things, of which I have spoken, spiritually, before they were naturally upon the face of the earth. For
            I, the Lord God, had not caused it to rain upon the face of the earth. And I, the Lord God, had created all the children
            of men; and not yet a man to till the ground; for in heaven created I them; and there was not yet flesh upon the earth,
            neither in the water, neither in the air

        <p>
            And inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall prosper, and shall be led to a land of promise; yea, even a
            land which I have prepared for you; yea, a land which is choice above all other lands.
